Generate cdpedia.exe for Windows autorun
========================================

The first step must be completed on Linux, the rest on Windows.

- Build a CDPedia image in test mode.

- Copy and extract the image to a Windows directory, e.g. `path\to\cdpedia_image\`.

- Install latest stable python 3.7 (32 bit).
  pyinstaller doesn't support python 3.8
  see https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/issues/4311
  
- Clone or get a copy of the CDPedia project.

- Create a virtualenv specifying python 3.7 (32 bit) as target interpreter:
  `virtualenv --python=path\to\python37_x86\python.exe venv_exe`

- Activate virtualenv and install dependencies: `pywin32` and `pyinstaller`

- From project dir, run `python utilities\make_autorun.py path\to\cdpedia_image`
  This creates a new cdpedia.exe in image dir that is also copied to project dir

- Run updated cdpedia.exe from image dir to test it

- If it's OK, commit the updated cdpedia.exe to the project and push.

- Done, the CDPedia test image is no longer needed.


Note: tested and working OK using python 3.7.8 32-bit virtualenv with
pytinstaller 4.0 in a Win10-x64 host.
