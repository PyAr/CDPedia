    <h2>What do I do with the file I downloaded?</h2>

    <p>You can download files in two formats.</p>

    <p>It can be a disk image (specially designed to fit on a CD or a DVD, depending
    on the version). The first thing you have to do is burn it to a blank disk,
    for which you need a burner and burning software. If you use Windows and don't
    have one installed on your computer, we recommend
    <a class="http" href="http://infrarecorder.org/?page_id=5">InfraRecorder</a>
    that is Free Software and very easy to use (as an example, you can
    <a class="http" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5QLoTl9qu8">see a video
    guide)</a>).</p>

    <p>It can also be a tarball, that is to say, directly the files ready to
    decompress and use. You can download and decompress them directly into a USB
    stick or on a hard disk, and use the CDPedia.</p>

    <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">
      <h4>Make copies to give away</h4>
      <p>If you have disks available, make some copies of CDPedia to give to your
      family and friends, to your neighborhood library, or to your children.</p>
      <p>Spread CDPedia!</p>
    </div>

    <h2>How do I use it?</h2>

    <p>You put the generated disk in your computer and when the folder with the CD
    is opened double click on the file cdpedia.py. Your browser will open with
    the cover of CDPedia.</p>

    <p>If you downloaded the compressed files, just unzip them into anywhere and
    that's all, no need to burn a disk.</p>

    <p>This version works on Linux, Mac or Windows without having to install any
    additional software (you only need Python which on Linux and Mac comes
    installed, and the version for Windows is included and used directly).</p>

    <p>To use the CDPedia in server mode (installing it on a single machine but
    accessing it from many others),
    <a href="https://wiki.python.org.ar/Proyectos/CDPedia/modoservidor/">these are
    the instructions</a>.</p>

    <h2 rel="download">More information</h2>
    <p>CDPedia is a <a href="http://python.org.ar">Python Argentina</a> project
    to access the information on Wikipedia even if you don't have
    an Internet connection.</p>

    <p>All information included was obtained from Wikipedia in the date indicated 
    above, and it's a picture of the online content at that given time. We suggest you
    to access information directly on the Wikipedia Web if you need
    information updated on one of the topics.</p>

    <p>Important: CDPedia is Free Software, we recommend (and thank you) to
    copy these disks and files, and give them to your friends, family and
    acquaintances. The information must be free, so we improve the quality of
    our education.</p>

    <p>Enjoy it!</p>
