# Languages and types of images for each
# Config for each type:
#   - type: which kind of image will be generated (tarball, iso)
#   - windows: if all Windows stuff will be put inside the image
#   - page_limit: quantity of pages to include in the image
#   - imaged_reduction: percentages to indicate how many images
#       will be reduced and how; for example, [10, 15, 25, 50] means:
#           10% of images will be included full size
#           15% of images will be reduced to 75% of the original size
#           25% of images will be reduced to 50% of the original size
#           50% of images will not be included at all
#       of course, the 4 percentages must add 100%
